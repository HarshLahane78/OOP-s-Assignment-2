    "Q.What is inheritance in Python? Explain its significance in object-oriented programming.\n",
    " \n",
    " inheritance is implemented by specifying the parent class in the definition of the child class. The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class, and it can also have its own additional attributes and methods. This relationship between classes forms an \"is-a\" relationship, where an object of the child class is also an object of the parent class.\n",

    "Significance of inheritance in object-oriented programming:\n",

    "Extensibility:\n",
    "New classes can be created by extending existing classes, adding or modifying functionality. This makes it easier to incorporate new features without affecting the existing code.\n",

    " What is name mangling in Python, and how does it affect encapsulation?\n",
    " \n",
    "Name mangling is a technique used in Python to make the names of attributes in a class more difficult to access from outside the class. This is done by adding a prefix to the attribute name, typically with a double underscore (__). The purpose of name mangling is not to provide strict security but rather to prevent accidental name conflicts in large codebases and to signal that a variable is intended to be used within the class.\n",
    "The use of name mangling is a convention, not a strict enforcement, and it is intended to avoid unintentional name clashes in code with large numbers of classes. It enhances encapsulation by making it more difficult for external code to accidentally access or modify attributes intended for internal use within a class. However, it's important to note that determined users can still access these attributes using the mangled names if they choose to do so. The main purpose is to signal that a variable is meant for internal use within the class.\n"

    "Q. What is abstraction in Python, and how does it relate to object-oriented programming ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction in Python, as well as in object-oriented programming (OOP) in general, is a fundamental concept that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on real-world entities and representing their essential characteristics. The goal is to hide the unnecessary details while exposing the essential features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstraction is often achieved through the use of classes and objects. Here's how abstraction relates to object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that characterize the object.\n",
    "Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class, with specific values for its attributes.\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: This is another OOP concept closely related to abstraction. It involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class. The internal details of how the data is stored or the methods are implemented are hidden from the outside, promoting information hiding and reducing complexity."

    "Q. Describe the benefits of abstraction in terms of code organization and complexity reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction in programming, especially in the context of object-oriented programming (OOP), offers several benefits related to code organization and complexity reduction. Here are some of the key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction promotes modularity by breaking down a system into smaller, manageable units (classes and objects). Each class encapsulates a specific set of functionalities, making it easier to understand, maintain, and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction allows for the creation of reusable components through the definition of classes and interfaces. Once a class is designed and implemented, it can be easily reused in other parts of the program or in different projects, reducing redundant code and saving development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Hiding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, a key aspect of abstraction, enables information hiding. Internal details of a class (implementation details) are hidden from the outside world, exposing only what is necessary for interaction. This reduces complexity by allowing changes to be made within a class without affecting the code that uses the class."

Composition is based on the idea that an object can be composed of other objects, and these relationships can be established dynamically at runtime.\n",

    "The key idea behind composition is to create objects by assembling or composing them from other objects, rather than inheriting their behavior.

    "\n",
    "Relationships:\n",

    "Inheritance: While inheritance provides a way to reuse code, it can lead to inflexible designs, especially when dealing with deep inheritance hierarchies. Changes to the base class can affect all derived classes.\n",

    "The concept of \"has-a\" relationships in composition refers to the idea that a class can have an instance of another class as one of its components. In other words, a class \"has\" another class as a part or attribute. This relationship is a fundamental aspect of composition in object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",

    "Q. Explain how composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition enhances code maintainability and modularity in Python programs by promoting a design approach that encourages the creation of smaller, independent components that can be easily understood, modified, and extended. Here are several ways in which composition contributes to these aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition encourages breaking down a complex system into smaller, self-contained modules or components. Each class or module can represent a specific functionality or concept. This modular design makes the codebase more organized and easier to manage.\n",
    "Code Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "With composition, individual components can be reused in various contexts. Since classes are designed to be independent, they can be used as building blocks for different parts of the system. This reusability reduces redundancy and makes it easier to leverage existing code in new projects or features.\n",
    "Flexibility and Adaptability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Components created through composition can be easily replaced or extended without affecting the entire system. This flexibility is valuable when requirements change or new features need to be added. Developers can introduce new components or modify existing ones with minimal impact on the rest of the codebase."
